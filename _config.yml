# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  我曾做過一個夢，夢見一個人獨自走在滾滾黃沙的邊緣，我看著遠方，一種孤獨的感覺由然而生，荒涼的沙漠沒有生機，人像被上帝遺棄的小孩，獨自面對這沒有生機的世界。這個夢境讓我不斷的去思索生命是什麼，為什麼世界長這個樣子，佛性或是所謂的上帝真的存在嗎？
